# stockgrowth-with-dividends
A script to calculate stock growth with continuously reinvested dividends. Allows the user to input specific values such as initial invested capital, expected annual growth, number of dividend payouts annually, annual dividend yield and amount of years of stockholding.
My first ever coding-project, made in order for me to calculate the potential of investing in $BK (TSE).
